# ProfilePage
Welcome to this week's homework submittion!  Created a web application from scratch! This is a portfolio page, which I can add to as the course progresses. 

A portfolio of work can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 

 Applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox*, media queries, and CSS variables; a website was created with my name

**Note:** Not enough web applications to showcase at this point; used placeholder images and names.

 


## User Story

```
AS AN employee
I WANT to have a deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT samples of this work can be assessed to increase probability of employment
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Portfolio meets standards of presentinh my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me

 
 I click one of the links in the navigation
Then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

When I click on the link to the section about my projects
Then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the future applications


The first application's image should be larger in size than the others




WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
